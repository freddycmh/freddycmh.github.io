    <h3 class="move">Activities</h3>
    <p class="description"><em>Nearly every NYC visitor heads to Central Park at some point, especially in
            summertime</em>—and these days it takes on added allure for those looking for a mix of fresh air and some
        physical distancing. Use this list as a starting block for exploring the City’s favorite green space (though
        even if you do all these things, you’re still only scratching the surface). Check off those you’ve done, get out
        to try the ones you haven’t and let us know your favorites and what we missed.</p>

    <p class="description"><strong>Land a largemouth bass</strong>—but make sure to release it—in Harlem Meer. Fishing
        poles and bait are available at the nearby Charles A. Dana Discovery Center.</p>

    <p class="description"><strong>Hear a new band at SummerStage,</strong> or catch one of your favorites there—plenty
        of well-known acts perform at Rumsey Playfield. This summer’s lineup should be announced soon.</p>

    <p class="description"><strong>Commune with Lennonites</strong>at Strawberry Fields’ Imagine Mosaic, which honors
        the Beatle who lived across the street in the Dakota Apartments. </p>
    <p class="description"><strong>Get your steps in at Belvedere Castle</strong>The panoramas from the viewing deck up
        high are more than worth ascending the tower.</p>
    <p class="description"><strong>Row your way around the Lake,</strong> or opt for a more relaxing gondola ride,
        either of which can be done from the Loeb Boathouse. Whichever you choose, you’ll get to explore the park’s
        largest natural body of water. </p>
    <p class="description"><strong>Yell “Free Bard” at Shakespeare in the Park</strong>OK, don’t actually yell
        that—you’d get a lot of odd looks—but do try to score tickets (which are free; keep checking the Public Theater
        website for updates) for a star-studded Shakespearean play at the Delacorte Theater. </p>
